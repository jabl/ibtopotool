ibtopotool is a tool that can parse an Infiniband topology file (as
generated by 'ibnetdiscover'), and do things. So far it supports:

- Generate a graphviz dot file for visualizing the IB network.

- Generate a slurm topology.conf configuration file.


Dependencies
============

This tool uses the `NetworkX library <https://networkx.github.io/>`_
version 2.x or newer to represent the nodes and links between
them.

In order to generate a slurm topology file, the `ClusterShell
library <https://clustershell.readthedocs.io>`_ is
required.

To generate graphviz output (the default), one needs the `pydot
library <https://github.com/pydot/pydot>`_.

To install all dependencies using a Python virtual environment:

.. code-block::

   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt

Alternatively, if using Debian or Ubuntu:

.. code-block::

   apt install python3-pydot python3-networkx python3-clustershell
